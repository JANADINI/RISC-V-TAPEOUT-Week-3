# RISC-V-TAPEOUT-Week-3

This repo covers three key stages of the RISC‑V VSDBabySoC verification flow, from synthesis to timing analysis, using open‑source tools.


 # Part 1 – Post‑Synthesis Gate‑Level Simulation
    

## Part 2 – Static Timing Analysis (STA) Fundamentals Guide


# Part 3 – OpenSTA Labs (Practical STA Execution)



   

    Achieved functional and timing correctness for VSDBabySoC.

    Verified end‑to‑end flow: Synthesis ➝ GLS ➝ Static Timing Analysis.

    Design is now ready for physical design and sign‑off.
